Okay, so let me think about what I need to get done today. First thing, I need to, uh, I need to call the dentist and reschedule that appointment for next week. Then I have to, um, finish the Johnson report - that's due by end of day tomorrow so I really can't put that off anymore.
Oh, and I almost forgot, I need to pick up groceries on the way home. Let's see, we need milk, bread, um, what else... oh right, chicken for dinner tomorrow. And, uh, probably should grab some vegetables too.
Also need to respond to Sarah's email about the project meeting. That's been sitting in my inbox for like three days now. And, and I should probably call mom, haven't talked to her all week.
What else... oh, the car needs gas. Better do that before I forget again. And I think there's laundry that needs to be moved to the dryer. Yeah, definitely need to do that when I get home. Format this as a to-do list in bullet points.
