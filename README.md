The application creates a `push_to_talk_config.json` file. Example configuration file:

```json
{
  "openai_api_key": "your_api_key_here",
  "stt_model": "gpt-4o-transcribe",
  "refinement_model": "gpt-4.1-nano",
  "sample_rate": 16000,
  "chunk_size": 1024,
  "channels": 1,
  "hotkey": "ctrl+shift+space",
  "toggle_hotkey": "ctrl+shift+t",
  "insertion_method": "sendkeys",
  "insertion_delay": 0.005,
  "enable_text_refinement": true,
  "enable_logging": true,
  "enable_audio_feedback": true
}
```

#### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|

#### Audio Quality Settings

- **sample_rate**:
  - `16000` (16kHz) - Recommended for speech (Whisper optimized)
  - `8000` (8kHz) - Lower quality but faster processing
  - `44100` (44.1kHz) - CD quality (overkill for speech, slower)

- **chunk_size**:
  - `512` - Lower latency, more CPU overhead
  - `1024` - Balanced (recommended)
  - `2048` - Higher latency, less CPU usage

- **channels**:
  - `1` - Mono recording (recommended for speech)
  - `2` - Stereo recording (unnecessary for speech-to-text)

### Hotkey Options

You can configure different hotkey combinations for both modes:

**Push-to-talk hotkey** (hold to record):
- `ctrl+shift+space` (default)
- `alt+space`
- `ctrl+alt+r`
- `f12`

**Toggle hotkey** (press once to start, press again to stop):
- `ctrl+shift+t` (default)
- `f11`
- `ctrl+alt+t`
- `alt+t`

Both hotkeys support any combination from the `keyboard` library.

### Text Insertion Methods

- **sendkeys** (default): Simulates individual keystrokes using pyautogui, better for special characters
- **clipboard**: Faster and more reliable, uses pyperclip and pyautogui for Ctrl+V

### Audio Feedback

The application includes clean and simple audio feedback:

- **Recording Start**: A crisp high-pitched beep (880 Hz) that signals recording has begun
- **Recording Stop**: A lower confirmation beep (660 Hz) that confirms recording completion
- **Non-Blocking**: Audio playback runs in separate threads to avoid interfering with recording or transcription
- **Configurable**: Can be toggled on/off via GUI or configuration JSON file
- **Cross-Platform**: Uses `pygame` and `numpy` for tone generation - works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Application Issues

1. **Application won't start**:
   - Make sure you're running as Administrator for hotkey detection
   - Check that the executable isn't blocked by antivirus
   - Try running from command line to see error messages

2. **Status indicators not updating**:
   - The GUI should show real-time status changes when starting/stopping
   - If stuck, try restarting the application
   - Check `push_to_talk.log` for error details

3. **Start/Stop button not working**:
   - Ensure all required fields are filled (especially OpenAI API key)
   - Use "Test Configuration" to validate settings
   - Check that no other instance is running

4. **Settings not saving**:
   - Ensure the application has write permissions in its directory
   - Check that the configuration file isn't marked as read-only
   - Try running as Administrator

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'pyautogui' or 'pyperclip'"** (Development):
   ```bash
   uv add pyautogui pyperclip
   ```

2. **"Could not find PyAudio"** (Development):
   - Install PyAudio: `uv add pyaudio`
   - On Windows, you may need Visual C++ build tools

3. **Hotkey not working**:
   - Run as administrator (required for global hotkey detection)
   - Check if another application is using the same hotkey
   - Try a different hotkey combination in the GUI
   - Ensure the application shows "Running" status in the GUI

4. **OpenAI API errors**:
   - Use the "Test Configuration" button in the GUI to validate settings
   - Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check your OpenAI account has access to the models you're using
   - Ensure internet connectivity

5. **Text not inserting**:
   - Make sure the target window is active and has a text input field
   - Try switching insertion method in the GUI (sendkeys vs clipboard)
   - Check Windows permissions for clipboard access
   - Increase insertion delay if text appears truncated

6. **GUI appearance issues**:
   - Try restarting the application
   - Check display scaling settings (recommended: 100-150%)
   - Ensure Windows is up to date

### Logging

Logs are written to `push_to_talk.log`. The GUI application logs only to file for cleaner user experience, while console mode logs to both file and console.

Log levels:
- INFO: Normal operation events
- WARNING: Non-critical issues
- ERROR: Critical errors

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Text Refinement Prompts

You can customize the text refinement behavior:

```python
from src import PushToTalkApp, PushToTalkConfig

app = PushToTalkApp()
app.text_refiner.set_custom_prompt(
    "Your custom refinement instructions here..."
)
```

### Programmatic Control

```python
from src import PushToTalkApp, PushToTalkConfig

# Create custom config
config = PushToTalkConfig()
config.hotkey = "f12"
config.toggle_hotkey = "f11"
config.enable_text_refinement = False

# Run application
app = PushToTalkApp(config)

# Update configuration dynamically
new_config = PushToTalkConfig()
new_config.openai_api_key = "new_key"
app.update_configuration(new_config)

# Change hotkeys
app.change_hotkey("ctrl+alt+r")  # Change push-to-talk hotkey
app.change_toggle_hotkey("ctrl+alt+t")  # Change toggle hotkey

# Toggle features
app.toggle_audio_feedback()  # Toggle audio feedback
app.toggle_text_refinement()  # Toggle text refinement

# Check status
status = app.get_status()
print(f"Push-to-talk hotkey: {status['hotkey']}")
print(f"Toggle hotkey: {status['toggle_hotkey']}")
print(f"Recording mode: {status['recording_mode']}")
print(f"Audio feedback enabled: {status['audio_feedback_enabled']}")

app.run()
```

### GUI Integration

```python
from src.config_gui import show_configuration_gui
from src.push_to_talk import PushToTalkConfig

# Show persistent configuration GUI
result, config = show_configuration_gui()
if result == "close":
    # User closed the application
    print("Application closed by user")
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Optimize audio settings**: Lower sample rates (8000-16000 Hz) for faster processing
2. **Disable text refinement**: For faster transcription without GPT processing
3. **Use clipboard method**: Generally faster than sendkeys for text insertion
4. **Short recordings**: Keep recordings under 30 seconds for optimal performance
5. **Monitor via GUI**: Use the status indicators to verify application is running efficiently

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Security**: GUI stores API keys securely; avoid sharing configuration files
- **Administrator Rights**: Required for global hotkey detection
- **Microphone Access**: Application needs microphone permissions
- **Network Access**: Required for OpenAI API calls
- **File Permissions**: Ensure configuration files have appropriate access controls
